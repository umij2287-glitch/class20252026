        <h2>span element</h2>
        <span style="color:blue;font-weight: bolder;">Mark Twain</span> had been a celebrity for a good many years
        before he could be persuaded to regard himself as anything more than an
        <span style="color:crimson;font-weight: bold;">accident</span>, a news-writer to whom distinction had come as a
        matter of good fortune rather than as a tribute to genius. Sooner or later his "vein" would be worked out, when
        he would of necessity embark in other pursuits.
